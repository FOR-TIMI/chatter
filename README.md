## Introduction
  Chatter is a social media application that allows users to interact with one another by posting, commenting, and liking posts. The application was created by Femi-Ladiran Erifeoluwa (also known as Timi) and Oghenebrume Akpadaka (also known as Brume).
  Our goal with Chatter is to provide a platform for users to connect with one another and share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences. The user-friendly interface and sleek design make it easy for users to navigate and engage with the community.
## User Story

  As a user, I want to be able to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences with other users in real-time. 
  I want to be able to post, comment, and interact with other users in a safe and secure environment. 
  I also want to have access to a wide range of features and tools that will help me connect and engage with other users more effectively.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A powerful and flexible NoSQL database that allows Chatter to store and retrieve data efficiently and quickly.
- Mongoose ODM: A powerful Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that simplifies interactions between MongoDB and the Chatter application.
- Express: A lightweight framework for building web applications and APIs that allows Chatter to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Node: A powerful runtime environment that allows Chatter to run JavaScript code on the server-side.
- React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows Chatter to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- Material-UI: A popular UI library that provides a wide range of Material Design components for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.

## Features
- Login and Signup: Users can create an account and log in to the application with their username and password.
- Profile: Users can view and edit their profile information, including their name, email, and bio.
- Home: The home page allows users to view and interact with other users' posts, including commenting, liking, and sharing.
- Search: Users can search for other users by name or username, allowing them to connect and interact with people they know.

   
## Security Measures
Chatter has implemented a number of security measures to ensure that users' data is kept safe and secure. These measures include:
 - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): A security mechanism that allows Chatter to restrict access to its APIs based on the origin of the request.
 - Helmet: A library that sets various HTTP headers to help protect against common security threats.
